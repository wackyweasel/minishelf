      # Notes:
      # If you still see "Permission denied to github-actions[bot]" (HTTP 403),
      # it's typically because the repository or organization disallows the
      # GITHUB_TOKEN from creating or pushing to the 'gh-pages' branch.
      # In that case create a Personal Access Token (with repo scope) and add
      # it to this repository as a secret (e.g. GH_PAGES_PAT), then replace
      # github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} with github_token: ${{ secrets.GH_PAGES_PAT }}
